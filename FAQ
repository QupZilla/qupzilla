FAQ

Q: I have been told to look for a file in my profile directory. So where is
   all my profile data stored?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Please select the menu entry Help -> Informations about application and then
   scroll to the Paths section.


Q: I have bookmarked a page, the star icon is shining, but I cannot see
   the bookmark in the Menu or in the bookmark panel. Where do I find it?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------      
A: When you add a bookmark from the star icon, it is automatically added
   to unsorted bookmarks folder. You will find it only in the library (Ctrl+Shift+O).
   You can move the bookmark to other folder in the star icon or in the library.
   

Q: I am getting a lot of SSL errors when visiting secured (https) pages.
   Why does this happen?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Your system CA certificates list is probably too small or even missing.
   You can check this in SSL Manager (Tools ->Preferences -> Privacy -> SSL Manager).
   If this is your case, you have to download the ca-bundle.crt file from
   https://github.com/nowrep/QupZilla/tree/master/other/ca-bundle.crt.
   It contains certificates from Debian's ca-certificates package and I am
   trying to update it as soon as it is updated in the Debian repository.
   
   After downloading this file, you may put it into $yourprofile/certificates/
   directory or in some other place. But then you have to add a new certificate
   path in the SSL Manager (last tab - settings).
   

Q: I cannot save any bookmark and my history is empty. What should I do?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: At first, please check that you have installed the Qt SQLite plugin.
   On Debian, this package is called libqt4-sql-sqlite.
   If you have it installed and you are still experiencing this issue,
   please run QupZilla from a terminal window and have a look at the output.
   If it contains something like
   
         QSqlQuery::value: not positioned on a valid record
         QSqlQuery::value: not positioned on a valid record
   
   it seems that your profile database is broken. You can check it by some
   SQLite database viewer. If the database is empty, then you can recover
   it by copying
       Windows: Program Files/QupZilla/data/profiles/default/browsedata.db
       Unix: /usr/share/qupzilla/data/profiles/default/browsedata.db
   into your profile directory.
   If it doesn't help, please open an issue.
   
   
Q: QupZilla is using a lot % of my CPU. What can I do to cool it down?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Well, the problem with using excessive amount of processor time is very likely
   caused by some flash content running in the browser (most likely bad coded
   adverts). You have 3 options to solve this:
    1) Completely disable Flash in preferences (Browsing -> Web Configuration ->
       Enable Plugins (Flash plugin)
    2) Use the Click2Flash plugin (Preferences -> Plugins -> WebKit plugins ->
       Enable Click2Flash). You will now have to manually start every flash content
       on a specific site.
    3) Use AdBlock to filter adverts. Menu Tools -> AdBlock -> Enable AdBlock.
       Before using AdBlock, you will have to update filters by clicking the
       Update Filters button.  
   
   
Q: When I add or edit my Search Engines and restart QupZilla, the changes won't stay.
   What's wrong?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: If you are using your own builds from git, you have probably an old version of
   the profile database file. The easiest way to upgrade your database is to edit
   the version file in your profile. Open it with some text editor and change
   1.0.0-rc1 (or whatever you have in it) to 1.0.0 and restart QupZilla.
   Your database should now be updated and changes won't be discarded on every
   restart anymore.
   

Q: I have heard that QupZilla supports importing bookmarks from other browsers, but
   I can't find this feature anywhere.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: This feature has been added in version 1.0.0-rc1. If you are using older version,
   please upgrade it either by downloading installable packages from github or from
   your distributions repository.
   Then you will find the Import Bookmarks option in Menu File -> Import Bookmarks...
   The importing wizard will then guide you through the importing process.
