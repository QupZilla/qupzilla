FAQ

Q: I have been told to look for a file in my profile directory. So where are
   all my profile data stored?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Go to Menu Help -> Informations about application and then scroll to 
   Paths section.


Q: I have bookmarked a page, the star icon is shining, but I cannot see
   the bookmark in Menu nor Bookmark Panel. Where is it?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------      
A: When you add a bookmark from the star icon, it is automatically added
   to unsorted bookmarks folder. You will see it only in Library (Ctrl+Shift+O).
   You can move the bookmark to other folder in star icon or in Library.
   

Q: I am getting a lot of SSL errors when visiting secured (https) pages.
   Why is that?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Your system CA Certificates list is probably too small or even missing.
   You can check it in SSL Manager (Preferences -> Privacy -> SSL Manager).
   If this is your case, you have to download ca-bundle.crt file from
   https://github.com/nowrep/QupZilla/tree/master/other/ca-bundle.crt .
   It contains certificates from Debian's ca-certificates package and I am
   trying to update it as soon as it is updated in Debian repository.
   
   After downloading this file, you may put it into $yourprofile/certificates/
   directory or in some other place, but then you have to add new certificate
   path in SSL Manager (last tab - settings).
   

Q: I cannot save any bookmark and my history is empty. What to do?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: At first, please check that you have installed Qt SQLite plugin.
   On Debian, this package is called libqt4-sql-sqlite.
   If you have it installed and you are still experiencing this issue,
   please run QupZilla from terminal and read the output.
   If it contains something like
   
         QSqlQuery::value: not positioned on a valid record
         QSqlQuery::value: not positioned on a valid record
   
   it seems that your profile database is broken. You can check it by some
   SQLite database viewer. If the database is empty, then you can recover
   it by copying
       Windows: Program Files/QupZilla/data/profiles/default/browsedata.db
       Unix: /usr/share/qupzilla/data/profiles/default/browsedata.db
   into your profile directory.
   If it doesn't help, please open an issue.
   
   
Q: QupZilla is using a lot % of my CPU. What can I do to cool it down?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Well, the problem with using excessive amount of processor time is very likely
   to be some Flash running in browser (most likely bad coded adverts).
   You have 3 options to do:
    1) Completely disable Flash in Preferences (Browsing -> Web Configuration ->
       Enable Plugins (Flash plugin)
    2) Use Click2Flash plugin (Preferences -> Plugins -> WebKit plugins ->
       Enable Click2Flash). You will now have to manually start every Flash content
       on site.
    3) Use AdBlock to filter adverts. Menu Tools -> AdBlock -> Enable AdBlock.
       Before using AdBlock, you need to update filters by clicking Update Filters
       button.  
   
   
Q: When I add or edit my Search Engines and restart browser, the changes won't stay.
   What's wrong?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: If you were using own builds from git, you have probably old version of profile
   database file. The easiest way to upgrade your database is to edit version file
   in your profile. Open it with some text editor and change 1.0.0-rc1 (or whatever
   you have in it) to 1.0.0-b4 and then restart browser.
   Your database should now be updated and changes won't be discarded on every
   restart anymore.
   

Q: I have heard that QupZilla supports importing bookmarks from other browsers, but
   I can't find this feature anywhere.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: This feature has been added in version 1.0.0-rc1. If you are using older version,
   please upgrade it either by downloading installable packages from github or from
   your distributions repository.
   Then you can find Import Bookmarks option in Menu File -> Import Bookmarks...
   Importing wizzard will then guide you with importing process.
