    \class QtLockedFile

    \brief The QtLockedFile class extends QFile with advisory locking
    functions.

    A file may be locked in read or write mode. Multiple instances of
    \e QtLockedFile, created in multiple processes running on the same
    machine, may have a file locked in read mode. Exactly one instance
    may have it locked in write mode. A read and a write lock cannot
    exist simultaneously on the same file.

    The file locks are advisory. This means that nothing prevents
    another process from manipulating a locked file using QFile or
    file system functions offered by the OS. Serialization is only
    guaranteed if all processes that access the file use
    QLockedFile. Also, while holding a lock on a file, a process
    must not open the same file again (through any API), or locks
    can be unexpectedly lost.

    The lock provided by an instance of \e QtLockedFile is released
    whenever the program terminates. This is true even when the
    program crashes and no destructors are called.
*/

/*! \enum QtLockedFile::LockMode

    This enum describes the available lock modes.

    \value ReadLock A read lock.
    \value WriteLock A write lock.
    \value NoLock Neither a read lock nor a write lock.

    returns \e true immediately. If this object has a lock of a
