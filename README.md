About QupZilla
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QupZilla is a new and very fast QtWebKit browser. It aims to be a lightweight web browser
available through all major platforms. This project has been originally started only
for educational purposes. But from its start, QupZilla has grown into a feature-rich browser.

QupZilla has all standard functions you expect from a web browser. It includes bookmarks,
history (both also in sidebar) and tabs. Above that, you can manage RSS feeds with an included
RSS reader, block ads with a builtin AdBlock plugin, block Flash content with Click2Flash
and edit the local CA Certificates database with an SSL Manager.

QupZilla's main aim is to be a very fast and very stable QtWebKit browser available to everyone.
There are already a lot of QtWebKit browsers available, but they are either bound to the KDE
environment (rekonq), are not actively developed or very unstable and miss important
features. But there is missing a multiplatform, modern and actively developed browser. QupZilla
is trying to fill this gap by providing a very stable browsing experience.

History
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The very first version of QupZilla has been released in Decemeber 2010 and it was written
in Python with PyQt4 bindings. After a few versions, QupZilla has been completely rewritten
in C++ with the Qt Framework. The Windows version of QupZilla was compiled using MingW, but due to
a huge problem with Flash, it is now compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 2008.
First public release was 1.0.0-b4.

Before you start compiling, make sure that you have installed the Qt (>=4.7) development libraries
and you have read the BUILDING information.

 * Hunspell development package for spellcheck
 * QtWebKit 2.3 is needed to have support for spellcheck

 * QtWebKit 2.3 is required
 * Hunspell library is required for spellcheck

Then you can start compiling by running this commands:

    $ qmake
